### Author: Joseph Bakes (created on 28th May, 2021)

## Description
This was created as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum. The aim is to build an app for managing a book collection.

### Things I've learned/practised
- Making objects (/classes) as functions
- Adding methods to the object's prototype
- (FUTURE GOAL) Storing data in localStorage

### Things to add/improve

### Patch notes (29th May, 2021)
- Basic setup for books to be displayed in a grid

### TODO (29th May, 2021)
- Create an 'edit' function for books (which can also be used for adding books)
    - Have a form in a div offscreen that slides into view for editing/adding books.
