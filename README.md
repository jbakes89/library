# Library App

### Author: Joseph Bakes (created on 28th May, 2021)

## Description
This was created as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript curriculum. The aim is to build an app for managing a book collection.

### Things I've learned/practised
- Making objects (/classes) as functions
- Adding methods to the object's prototype
- Having an offscreen menu that can be opened and closed
- (FUTURE GOAL) Storing data in localStorage

### Things to add/improve

### Patch notes (29th May, 2021)
- Setup a functioning edit menu that allows books to be added to the library
- Setup edit and delete functions for existing books

### TODO (29th May, 2021)
- Bind the checkboxes on each book with the `hasBeenRead` property
- Build upon edit function
    - Add a button for adding new books
    - Build 'has been read' parameter into the edit function
- Add localStorage function
- Workout how to handle long text
    - flexible font size?
    - limit max length?
    - ellipsis or other suitable overflow method?
- Other improvements to appearance
